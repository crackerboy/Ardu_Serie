   Project name: JayThree Time_Lapse CAM Project #arduSerie 36
     A very cool project that captures images for a predetermined time. 
     Serves as a time lapse camera. It is widely used in biology, 
     for the study of human or animal behavior. Have a good time!!!
     
     Flavour II - SDCard Dumping File

   Revision History:
     Oct, 2017
       - v 1.0 - Medium webpage:
   Description:
           Testing openning file: log.csv (it must be on the disk - run Flavor I)
           This example shows how to read once a file from the SD card using the
           SD library and send it over the serial port. It does not use loop()!

  SD card file dump
  Testing openning file: datalog.txt
 
 This example shows how to read a file from the SD card using the
 SD library and send it over the serial port.
 	
 The circuit:
 * SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
 ** MOSI - pin 11
 ** MISO - pin 12
 ** CLK - pin 13
 ** CS - pin 4
