  J3C3 - Controlling Motor - Techniques For Driving Inductive Load  - L9110S
   Code II
   Ino File: _47_L9110_test_motor_02.ino
   Use: L9110S - https://www.elecrow.com/download/datasheet-l9110.pdf

   Objective: Hi, What are the best options for controlling motors with inductive loads?
   Here I invastigate L9110S - Motor control driver chip;)

   Instructions (CODE SEQUENCE)
      (1) The control: simply the DC MOTOR, L9110 and Arduino;
      (2) We add the movement forward and back frozen in the code;
      (2) We add a potentiometer to vary the speed; no L9110 chip; single direction;
      (4) We add the potentiometer and the state machine; L9110 chip returns:)
      (5) We refined the code to present a menu, a la carte!; That's all!

   Connections:
    LM9110 & MOTOR
    A -> 3
    B -> 4
    vcc in vin & gnd (use external power 9v)

   Note:
    Whenever possible add complexity gradually to your code:)
